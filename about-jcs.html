      <h2>Why represent Jesus Christ on the XRP Ledger?</h2>
      <p>
        Jesus is proclaimed in word and deed — through Scripture, teaching, community, and prayer. In a digital economy, the XRP Ledger offers a public, auditable rail where stewardship can be practiced with integrity: rapid settlement reduces friction for generosity; transparent ledgers foster trust and accountability; and open standards invite the Body to build together across borders. Representing Christ on XRPL is not about branding a blockchain with a name, but about forming a witness: honest measures, clear governance, and shared responsibility that reflect the Kingdom’s values. When gifts flow with clarity, and communities can verify how they’re used, teaching becomes embodied, fellowship is strengthened, and prayerful action becomes measurable — a light set on a stand in the commons of our time.
