# Jesus Christ Saves Token (JCS) · Website

> _“And the Word became code, and the code dwelt among us.”_

This repository holds the **About** and **Landing** pages of **Jesus Christ Saves Token (JCS)**,  
a faith-based project born on the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)** —  
a distributed temple of transactions where transparency is worship and integrity is currency.

---

## ✝️ Mission

- To proclaim Christ’s message in **digital form**:  
  not in fading ink, but in **immutable ledger entries**.  
- To blend **faith** and **innovation**:  
  the seed of belief coded into the architecture of tomorrow.  
- To show the world that **tokens** can be more than speculation —  
  they can be vessels of community, prayer, and stewardship.

## 🌐 Pages

- **index.html** — Genesis of the project:  
  golden **Sign the Ledger** button, live metrics, roadmap, FAQ.  
- **about-jcs.html** — Epistle to the faithful:  
  vision, core values, YouTube Word embed, metrics, trade links, expanded roadmap.

Each page mirrors the **angelic aesthetic**:  
blue-to-gold gradients, glowing typography, cryptic light-ray backgrounds.

## 📊 Metrics (Living Data)

The site fetches directly from XRPL and CoinGecko:  

- JCS/XRP order book (price discovery via `book_offers`)  
- XRP/USD pair (CoinGecko API)  
- Circulating supply (via `account_lines`)  
- Market capitalization, computed like manna in the desert  

This is not static ink — but living scripture that **updates every 60s**.

## 🕯️ Style & Tone

This project is deliberately **cryptic** yet **clear**,  
a paradox echoing scripture: **mystery revealed, but only to those who seek.**

- Light effects = “Let there be light”  
- Golden button = covenant call to action  
- Particles (crosses) = witnesses drifting heavenward  
- Parchment cards = scrolls of information  

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

- **HTML** built with faith-driven design principles.  
- **CSS** styled with gradients, glows, and cryptic flourishes.  
- **JS** connecting to XRPL like prayer connects to heaven.  
- **Commits** written in poetic code-liturgical style.
